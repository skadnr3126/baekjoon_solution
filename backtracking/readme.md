#idea of backtracking

backtracking algorithm is typically dfs,bfs search

but it make the search-process better by ignoring a non_condition node

in this repos, when i have some grape, im gonna solve backtracking problem by using stack, queue, recursive in an appropriate way


1.recursive
it's a most intuitive way to search
when you have the rigth condition to go into next floor, then call the function
this next floor is played by "recursive(next)"


2.stack




3.queue
